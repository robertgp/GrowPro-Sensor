# GrowPro-Sensor
This repo shows my work to create the first working prototype of GrowPro's sensor.
GrowPro is a start up that aims to create a sensor that allows you to determine how healthy a plant is. 
It measures light, humidity, temperature and soil moisture, and communicates these metrics to a master node 
that will in turn send them to be displayed in the user's app. Most of my work was focused on getting the sensors to
work together and sending the information via radio. 
GrowPro was accepted at the Inovate@BU Summer Accelerator in 2018.
